# klug

klug is a toy language project to allow me to accomplish a few goals:

1. Get to know Rust a little better.

> > :memo: Currently I am following the tutorial [here](https://arzg.github.io/lang/) to familiarize myself with Rust. 

2. Implement language features I've learning in CS3520 at the University of Utah in a language that isn't Racket.
