klug
====

klug is a toy language project to allow me to accomplish a few goals:

1. Get to know Rust a little better.

2. Implement language features I've learned in CS3520 at the University of Utah (in a language that isn't Racket).

This will mostly be done in my free time so progress will be ... slow :)

:warning: this project is largely abandoned, see `jplc` for a more recent project.
